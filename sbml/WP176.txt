The folic acid-centred micronutrient biological network. The most relevant biochemical processes related to folic acid in the context of metabolism, oxidation and inflammation are represented. Also, the compartmental separation (intracellular vs. plasma) is presented, identifying the folic acid centred plasma metabolome.

Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP176 CPTAC Assay Portal]
